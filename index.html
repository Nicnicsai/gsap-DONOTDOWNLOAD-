                <h3>Batman dummy text:</h3>
                <p>Every man who has lotted here over the centuries,
                    has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom.
                    So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater
                    foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true
                    despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison
                    their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them
                    climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city.
                    And then when you’ve truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra’s
                    Al Ghul’s destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is…
                    ashes Then you have my permission to die.</p>

                <h3>Dj Khaled dummy text:</h3>
                <p>Don’t ever play yourself. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. They key is to have every
                    key, the key to open every door. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne.
                    Cocoa butter is the key. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. Give
                    thanks to the most high. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful
                    souls, clean heart, angel.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me,
                    Lion! Don’t ever play yourself. They don’t want us to win. They don’t want us to win. Watch your
                    back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there.
                    A major key, never panic. Don’t panic, when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. It’s on
                    you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Give
                    thanks to the most high. Eliptical talk. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool,
                    do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. Life is what you make
                    it, so let’s make it. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. In life there will be
                    road blocks but we will over come it. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to
                    success.</p>
